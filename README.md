# TextCompresseion-Huffman-
lossless compression using c++


Have implemented the huffman algorithm
- where i built a hashmap to find the frequency of the all the charachters in the file 
- Built a Huffman tree mainly using a Priority Queue
- Finally used Recursion to encode and decode the Text file 

Things to do 
-Implemet the same using file 
-Actually try converting the characters to bits using c++ <bitset> library
